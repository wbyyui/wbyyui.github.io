It is much easier to build a site with templates and on github than writing codes from scratch. And I think the template makes my website looks clear.

Unfortunately, now I don't have lots of contents to write in the site. So now the site isn't with many differences from the original template. I hope I can write more (at least paste some papers or give a detailed CV) in the future. 

And at least trying to create a site is better than just playing games at home. Please at least study for some time from now, wbyyui.

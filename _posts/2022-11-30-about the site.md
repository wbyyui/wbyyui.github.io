It is much easier to build a site with templates and on github than writing codes from scratch. And I think the template makes my website looks clear.

The site is still in progress. Therefore, now the site isn't with many differences from the original template. I hope I can write more in the future. I want to add something new about me, and (if possible) my projects.

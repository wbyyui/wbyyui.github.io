Here is the archive for course projects I have done.



[Fundamentals of Cryptography: Research into Singular Elliptic Curve Groups](/../files/crypto-elliptic-curve.pdf)

About singular curves and how the use of them may influence the elliptic curve cryptography.



[Game Theory: A Literature Review of Fair Sharing and Envy-freeness](/../files/gt-envy-free.pdf)

About fair sharing and envy-freeness, especially surveying about the recent results on EF1 and EFX for discrete problems.



[Design and Analysis of Algorithms: Bottleneck Path Algorithms](/../files/aad-bottleneck-path.pdf)

About different bottleneck path algorithms: s-t BP in $O(m\beta(m,n))$ and SSBP in $O(m\sqrt{logn})$.

 

[Advanced Topics in Cryptography: On Approximating the Covering Radius and Finding Dense Lattice Subspaces](/../files/crypto-lattice-subspace.pdf)

Joint project with Shucheng Chi and Tianle Xie, surveying about the paper.

## Problem

For any matrix without same entry values, prove that there is a saddle point, which means a place which is both a row minimum and a column maximum.

## Sol

Find the one with the maximal value among all row minimums.

Find the one with the minimal value among all column maximums.

If there's no saddle points, then they are two different places.

Considering the four entries within the rows and columns of these places leads to a contradiction.

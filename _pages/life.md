## Food

- Everything local in China, especially food in Shandong, Hunan (spicy) and Shanghai.

- Everything non-Chinese in the US, especially burgers and Indian food.

- Fried chicken in KFC, which is the most consistent and delicious thing in China and in the US.

## Rhythm Games

- I am familiar with almost all rhythm games, especially mobile ones.

- See my [best score](/../images/testify.jpg) and also my [favorite song](/../images/corps.jpg) from the game [Arcaea](https://arcaea.lowiro.com/). I am a top-200 player in Arcaea. 

- Also see a [poster](/../images/tusile.pdf) I made for a series of rhythm game cups in Tsinghua University.

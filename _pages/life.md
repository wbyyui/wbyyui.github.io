### Rhythm Games

I am familiar with almost all rhythm games, especially mobile ones.

I am a top-200 player in the game [Arcaea](https://arcaea.lowiro.com/).

See a [screenshot](/../images/testify.jpg) from Arcaea and also a [poster](tusile.png) I made for a series of rhythm game cups in Tsinghua University.

## Food

- Most things local in China, especially food in Shandong, Hunan (spicy) and Shanghai.
- Some non-Chinese food in the US, especially burgers and Indian food.
- Fried chicken in KFC, which is the most consistent flavor in China and in the US (and everywhere).
- Traditional Japanese cuisines are well-made but simply flavored / taste similar. 
- I can't say anything special for Bulgarian (hopefully all European?) food, but they are really good.

## Puzzle Games

- Baba is you
- Understand
- Tametsi / 14 Minesweeper Variants
- Leap Year
- Bean and nothingness (recommended by Yeyuan Chen)
- Patrick's Parabox
- A=B (however I refuse coding in puzzle games now)
- IMO / ICPC problems

## Rhythm Games

- I am familiar with almost all rhythm games, especially mobile ones. I am a top-200 player in [Arcaea](https://arcaea.lowiro.com/). 
- See [a video](https://youtu.be/f_nWGo6ATh0) that I plays some chart in the game Paradigm:Reboot.
- Also see a [poster](/../images/tusile.pdf) (in Chinese) that I made for a series of rhythm game cups in Tsinghua University.
